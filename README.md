glass-camera
============

simple google glass camera app for demo

What
----
this uses the camera intent to take a picture and store it 'silently' 
a preview picture will be given after and it will deposit into your pictures.
Found the traditional camera taking pictues would clutter the view stream when I wanted it to just go away

Also more glass code on the web never hurts. 

Usage
-----
invoke using, 'ok, glass simple camera'  

ToDo
----
File explorer
